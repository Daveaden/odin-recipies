    <h1>jersey fresh tomato soup</h1>
    <img src="../images/tomato soup.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 300px">
    <p>New Jersey is a well-known producer of tomatoes.
        Having our own garden leaves us with an abundance at the end of the
        season. Not wanting the tomatoes to go to waste,
        Hubby and I came up with our favorite version of tomato soup</p>
        <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>7 cups peeled, seeded, and chopped tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 cup finely chopped carrots</li>
                <li>¾ cup finely chopped onion</li>
                <li>1 (13.75 ounce) can chicken broth</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons sea salt</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 cup 2% milk</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon celery salt</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>STEPS</h3>
        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring the tomatoes, carrots, and onion to a boil over medium-high heat in a stockpot, then reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer for 30 minutes.
                    Stir in the chicken broth, sugar, and salt.
                </li>
                <li>Melt the butter over medium-low heat in a small saucepan. Whisk in the flour, stirring until thick. Slowly whisk in the milk until smooth.
                    Cook and stir, whisking constantly until thickened, about 5 minutes, then stir milk mixture in to the stockpot.
                    . Season with basil, celery salt, black pepper, and garlic powder. Continue to simmer the soup on low to reduce and thicken, about 1 hour.
                </li>
